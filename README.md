This repository contains the files referenced in "[julia as a cli
calculator](https://krasjet.com/rnd.wlk/julia/)", plus a Jupyter notebook
containing all the input code blocks.

Jupyter notebook's capability is too limiting for the code examples to work.
Part of the reason is that I'm using multiple programming languages, and the
other part is that Julia's REPL has several modes, i.e. help mode, Julian mode,
package mode, and shell mode, which doesn't seem to be available in IJulia. I
would still suggest you work through the examples in a Julia REPL session run
from the command line instead.
